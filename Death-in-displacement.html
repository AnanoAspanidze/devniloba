          <p class="label">Death in Displacement:</p>
          <h4 class="heading">the Unusual Case of Vedzisi Cemetery</h4>
          <p class="author">By Anna Japaridze</p>

        <article>
          <p>
            In 2006, Nino Guraspishvili bought 1500 square meters of land on a
            hillside that lay between the Nutsubidze and Vashlijvari
            neighborhoods in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi. Nino, a mother of
            four, was living in a cramped apartment at the time and she intended
            to build a house for her family in the fast-developing neighborhood.
            Little did she expect that over 15 years later, she would remain
            locked in a protracted dispute over claims to the hillside. Nino
            continues to live in her original one-room apartment, while the plot
            of land she had hoped to inhabit has instead become home to the
            deceased relatives of internally displaced people (IDP). This
            unusual case raises questions about property rights in Tbilisi, and
            the fate of the hillside ultimately reflects Georgia’s unruly social
            and economic developments over the past three decades since the
            nation regained independence.<br /><br />
            Nino claims the land was empty when she purchased it. The plot and
            surrounding area were officially zoned as recreational land, which
            meant no business — and certainly no cemetery — could be established
            there. It was only after she had purchased the property that she
            claims to have noticed a handful of gravesites on the plot directly
            below hers. As time went on, the problem got worse.
          </p>
          <img src="images/Drone.jpeg" alt="story" />
          <p>
            Nino recalls how the number of graves steadily increased and began
            to ascend up the hillside toward her property. Her first instinct
            was to build a concrete wall, but this action fell short. “When we
            returned a year later, the wall had been destroyed and there were
            around 30 new gravesites established on our territory,” she said.<br /><br/>
            Everyone she turned to advised her to take the matter to court, but
            she was unable to afford the legal fees. In a last-ditch effort,
            Nino attempted to register the land as a cemetery; by selling
            portions of it as commercial burial sites, she hoped she might
            recoup at least some fraction of her initial investment. Her request
            was flatly refused, as officials reminded her of the area’s
            recreational zone status. It was illegal for a cemetery to operate
            on her land, and yet a cemetery had taken shape.<br /><br/>
            According to Nino, no one — not the police, the state, or the
            gravediggers involved — has taken responsibility for the matter. Her
            case is all the more bizarre for the fact that surrounding portions
            of the hillside are now managed by the municipal government as a
            commercial cemetery.<br/><br/>
            “Everyone thinks that it isn’t their problem and that the case is
            closed. I think when it’s a citizen’s problem, the state should get
            involved,” she says. “I raised four children in one room. And why?
            For the sake of what? When I had the chance to give normal
            circumstances to my children and to build a normal house. They [the
            IDPs] didn’t give me the opportunity to do that, and I don’t see why
            I should be responsible for saving them.”<br /><br/>
            Over a dozen years have passed and yet the impasse persists: the
            city won’t recognize the cemetery, Nino cannot build her house, and
            the families who buried loved ones there live in uncertainty over
            their fate.<br /><br />
            **** <br /><br />To understand the quandary that surfaced on this
            hillside, it’s necessary to return to the 1990s, Georgia’s first
            decade of independence from the Soviet Union. The decade was
            characterized by civil war and societal collapse, and saw a huge
            influx of people displaced by conflicts in Abkhazia and South
            Ossetia. Social provisions were scarce, and many of the displaced,
            commonly referred to as IDPs, were forced to squat in repurposed
            buildings that were unsuitable for long-term housing. The
            government, wracked by conflict, lawlessness and corruption, had few
            resources with which to attend to the displaced. IDPs were largely
            on their own.<br /><br />
            Often, those who fled their homes in Abkhazia and South Ossetia did
            so suddenly in the belief that they would return. In addition to
            losing their homes, land and possessions, they were forced to leave
            behind generations of their ancestors buried in family plots. IDPs,
            like most of the population of Georgia, typically follow the
            Georgian Orthodox faith, which considers soil to be sacred.<br /><br />
            The religion ordains that the dead be returned to the soil, and
            significant events in the Orthodox calendar involve graveside
            visits. For instance, long Easter holidays are capped by visits to
            the cemetery to pay respects to one’s deceased.
          </p>
          <img src="images/cross2.jpeg" alt="story" />
          <p>
            “Graves are a means of being reunited with the soil,” social
            researcher Nana Chabukiani writes in her journal article, <a href="http://journals.ed.ac.uk/unfamiliar/article/view/504" target="_blank">Ancestor
              Worship and Disrupted Continuity among IDPs in Georgia.</a><br/><br/> “Soil is
            crucial as it is a source of the future — people are created from
            soil — and it also represents the past — ancestors turn into soil
            after their burial. Through burial at the place where people lived,
            the continuity of a community can be sustained; but this continuity
            is disrupted by displacement, making it more difficult for IDPs to
            adjust to the new place of residence.”<br /><br/>
            Not only does out-of-placeness persist in the daily lives of many
            IDPs, but the inability to be buried in their native soil prolongs
            this sense of restlessness and indeterminancy after death. “In
            Georgia, most rituals are tied to the home and graveyard,”
            anthropologist Keti Gurchiani observes. “The body is the soul long
            after death. It should be brought home, where the soul will remain.
            Months, if not years after a burial, families attend to the deceased
            as a combination of body and a soul.”<br /><br/>
            When IDPs settled in Tbilisi, not only were they unable to fulfill
            obligations to their deceased family members — they struggled to
            find an accessible place to bury those who later passed away in the
            city. Plots of land in Tbilisi’s cemeteries were often prohibitively
            expensive, and IDPs were confronted by the problem of how and where
            to settle their deceased. “The 1990s was a period marked by chaos,
            corruption and the absence of the rule of law and public
            institutions,” urbanist Irakli Zhvania notes. “A lot of people did
            whatever they wanted to do by ignoring any kind of regulations or
            laws. Or maybe simply, such regulations did not exist.”<br /><br/>
            A former deaf-mute shelter sits at the base of the cemetery, and
            offers a clue to its origins: since 1993, the building has housed a
            community of internally displaced people. Oleg Khajomia was among
            the first few families to settle there. At the age of 21, he fled
            his hometown of Ochamchire on the last train out of Abkhazia, and
            eventually settled at the repurposed shelter with 10-20 other IDP
            families. The hillside was wild, and without access to electricity
            or heating, the IDPs scavenged for firewood in the nearby forests of
            Lisi Lake.<br /><br/>
            “There was nothing here. No beds, no cutlery, nothing at all. The
            army entered alongside us. Then the army left, and people began to
            be born here. The population grew increasingly large, and now
            there’s not enough space,” Oleg says.<br /><br/>
            Oleg rests on the front steps of the building’s entrance, which
            faces directly onto a view of the cemetery. Today, the former
            deaf-mute shelter is home to approximately 150 families. For the
            building’s residents, life and death exist in close proximity. Many
            of the graves, like houses, contain a social space — benches and
            chairs in which to receive guests — and offerings of food, flowers,
            and glasses of wine are left behind as gifts to the deceased.

          <p>
            According to Oleg, the first person to bury their dead on the
            hillside was a resident of the shelter. These days, acquiring a
            burial site requires proof of death from an authorized agency,
            typically the ambulance services. In the mid-1990s, when the state
            struggled to provide the most basic services for the living, the
            provision of death certificates was overlooked. Like every other
            aspect of their preliminary experience in displacement, the matter
            of burial was self-directed and organized informally.<br /><br/>
            At the time, IDPs lived in a state of suspended hope for their
            return. “We thought that today, or tomorrow, we would take them back
            out,” Oleg says. Initial burial sites were shallow, and the burials
            were performed in such a way that — should the path to Abkhazia
            reopen — the bodies could be easily exhumed for their return.<br /><br/>
            Three decades on from his displacement, Oleg continues to hold hope
            for a way home. Sympathetic Abkhazians send him photos and videos of
            his native town. “Time has stopped there,” he reflects. Nonetheless,
            if given the chance, he would venture to move his ancestors buried
            in Abkhazia to Tbilisi — after 30 years, the ability to access their
            gravesites and perform religious duties has taken precedence over
            their burial location.<br /><br/>
            The exhumation and evacuation of ancestors in occupied regions
            presents a formidable logistical challenge. However, it appears that
            a few have found a way; Oleg says he knows at least one individual
            who, with great difficulty, managed to smuggle his parents’ bones in
            a small box from Abkhazia to Vedzisi Cemetery a handful of years
            ago.<br /><br/>
            After the first person was buried, news of the hillside’s
            availability for burials began to spread among neighboring IDPs.
            When Fatema Darsalia’s father-in-law died, she laid him to rest
            there. <br/><br/> ‘In 1999, the land was free: they said just bring your dead
            here. It was a dreadful neighborhood with tall grass, languishing in
            rubbish. Now it’s like a miracle — it’s the most prestigious
            neighborhood,” she says.<br /><br />
            Fatema, an IDP from Abkhazia who lived in the Nutsubidze area for 15
            years, has buried several of her relatives there. Today, she lives
            in a small, private house where she raises farm animals near the
            town of Rustavi. She acquired this home after a convoluted struggle
            with the state ministry for IDPs; in 2010, she and 14 other IDP
            families were left on the street for 197 days after their homes in
            Nutsubidze flooded following nearby construction. Her mother died
            during that period of homelessness, and she was also laid to rest in
            the hillside cemetery. A few years later, her deceased mother was
            once again threatened by the prospect of displacement.<br /><br />
            "In 2010, I buried my mother. In 2014, my brother. And soon after
            that, a letter appeared from that woman, stating that that land was
            hers. There’s a line there, and above that line there’s a commercial
            cemetery. Down below, it’s ours. They showed us the line then: you
            don’t have the right to go beyond here, they’ve bought the land. But
            below that it was ours, wasn’t it? So why did they sell it? They
            thought no more IDPs would die?”<br /><br/>
            Fatema contends that the hillside was originally granted to a
            resident of the former deaf mute shelter by Tbilisi’s City Hall. She
            draws on the logic of cemetery planning in Georgia, which holds that
            a burial site can be used for burials again after a period of 15
            years: “I know that it’s acceptable to build a new cemetery on an
            older one, and since there was already a prior cemetery there, that
            was why they gave us this one.”<br /><br />
            Both Oleg and Fatema mention the existence of this older cemetery on
            the hillside. Sure enough, two graves still stand at the far end —
            at the base of what is now a car wash facility —with dates of death
            from the 1940s to the 50s. The rest are no longer visible, as Fatema
            claims that a nearby, half-developed housing block has been built
            directly over them. "A cemetery, 50 years old, I asked them…is this
            acceptable? You wouldn’t step on top of a cemetery, would you? This
            is the same thing. There were a lot of them, fenced off,” she
            recalls.<br /><br />
            ***<br /><br />
            Today, the cemetery is almost out of space. Nino Guraspishvili has
            finally acquired a team of lawyers and is preparing to take the land
            dispute to court. She is requesting that either the authorities
            grant her another, similar piece of land; that they compensate her
            with the land’s current worth; or otherwise, that the dead be
            exhumed from her property.<br /><br/>
            “The state has resorted to all kinds of hand-grinding to avoid
            conceding the illegality that has taken place,” Nino’s lawyer,
            Mamuka Qavlashvili, comments. They have applied to court to resolve
            the case; by law, there should be a maximum two-month duration to
            process and deliver a result for such claims, but his legal team
            have been waiting for well over a year.<br /><br />
            There are various reasons why authorities may be reluctant to
            process the case. According to Mamuka, one might be a reaction to
            the sensitivity around burial sites in Georgian culture; whilst
            Tbilisi’s municipal government have been unrestrained in their
            evictions of IDPs from territories that could be put to more
            lucrative ends, interfering with a burial site for the dead could
            provoke a stronger public backlash — a place of residence may be
            liable to change, but a gravesite is intended to be the body’s final
            resting place. “Ultimately, the state doesn’t want another noisy
            media event, because the great majority of those gravesites belong
            to IDPs,” Mamuka says. “You can imagine what a sensitive issue it
            is, the matter of exhuming dead bodies and moving them elsewhere.
            That’s why the state is avoiding the performance of its duty.”<br /><br />
            Chai Khana tried repeatedly to reach Tbilisi City Hall for comment
            to no avail. <br /><br />***<br /><br />
            For the IDPs, Vedzisi cemetery holds space for the expression of
            grief, and provides a community in exile. In burying their relatives
            there, the IDPs have begun to tentatively engender a bond with this
            once-unfamiliar soil. When asked whether he would consider moving to
            a different neighborhood, Oleg shakes his head. “I’d prefer to stay
            here, because all of my people are buried here. Where should I go? I
            have no interest in partying and having fun. If I go, I go up there
            [to the cemetery].”<br /><br />
            “When you haven’t seen a person for so long and you go there and you
            cry, it relieves your heart a little,” Fatema explains. “When I
            would return home from funerals, I would say I took pleasure in my
            day. My husband makes fun of me — he says 'woman, what are you
            saying? You were at a funeral.’ But I saw my people, and I cried! It
            relieved my heart a little, that we sat together, and we cried. That
            is my pleasure; I’m not pleased that they died.”
