            Maia Zubashvili, 57, has not felt at home since she was forced to
            flee her village in South Ossetia during the 2008 war. Today she and
            her son Soso Zubashvili, 33, live in a 27 square meter room in a
            renovated former music school in Gori, a mid-sized city in central
            Georgia.<br /><br />
            “You come to hate entering the building. When you look at it, it
            looks exactly like the home of displaced people, it’s in terrible
            condition,” Maia told Chai Khana.<br /><br />
            Maia was displaced during the 2008 war when her village, Kheiti,
            which is located north of Tskhinvali, was occupied. She and her son
            were initially moved to the capital, Tbilisi, and settled in a
            kindergarten in the Gldani district which had been repurposed to
            house internally displaced persons (IDP).<br /><br />
            One day in early 2009, she received an unexpected call from an
            unknown government employee who gave her the option to go live in
            one of two villages—Shavshvebi or Berbuki—or near a factory in Gori.
            Knowing that the two villages were far from any cities but unaware
            of the conditions that awaited her in Gori, Maia chose to live in
            Gori to be closer to jobs.

            appearance is during election season, when officials are eager to
            make an impression to garner votes. As soon as polling stations
            close however, they seem to be just another problem for someone else
            to solve. (Credit: Maryam Mumladze)

            While thousands of families received newly built cottages in the
            villages of Shavshvebi and Berbuki, among other nearby settlements,
            Maia and her son were each given 27 square meters, partitioned by
            plasterboard walls, to live in. Having rented out one of the rooms
            to add to their income, Maia now shares the space she was given with
            her son, daughter-in-law, and four grandchildren. <br /><br />“Forty
            families live in a renovated, former music school that was meant to
            house 20 families. There aren’t even basic conditions here, we have
            mold everywhere, access to water is limited and leaks are frequent
            causing constant fights between neighbors,” she added, “We don’t
            have any hope that anyone will give us a new home.”

          <p>
            By 2020 the Georgian government—through budgetary funds and donor
            programs—had resettled 42,000 families, with another 40,000
            continuing to await housing. Many, like Maia, have found, however,
            that what the government calls a “durable housing solution” is
            unsustainable. <br /><br />Their circumstances in part are a
            reflection of the Georgian government’s failure to put together a
            comprehensive plan to solve the housing crisis facing its citizens.
            The initial Law on IDPs was adopted in 1996, three years after the
            end of the Abkhazian war, which displaced nearly 250,000 Georgians.
            It only provided initial recognition of their status and temporary
            solutions such as covering the costs of transportation to where they
            would be housed, however.<br /><br />
            In the absence of any government solutions, many sought shelter with
            family members, friends, or in repurposed and dilapidated buildings
            like factories, hotels, clinics, government buildings, and former
            student housing. <br /><br />While Georgia did put together a state
            strategy in 2007 that was meant to address all the aspects of
            displacement from housing to healthcare, employment, education and
            legal status, the implementation of specific projects has proven to
            be more complicated. Indeed a few of the residents at the former
            music school in Gori express a sense of injustice and frustration at
            the seemingly haphazard selection process through which some end up
            being luckier than others.<br /><br />
            “A major challenge in the field of IDPs are the more than 300 old
            collective settlements that are in ruins, depreciated and
            life-threatening. 20,000 people live in such conditions. They need
            urgent accommodation. There is poverty in these settlements,” Meri
            Bitsadze, the Communications Coordinator at the Charity Humanitarian
            Center “Abkhazeti” (CHCA), told Chai Khana. <br /><br />The
            government did introduce a point system in 2013 to try to streamline
            the process and prioritize which families received housing over
            others. To assign points, the Ministry looks at factors such as a
            family's income as well as if family members fit any special
            categories for pensioners, veterans, handicapped family members, or
            family members who passed away during the two conflicts. The
            Ministry also takes into account the living conditions in their
            current residence. After initial scoring is conducted, families have
            to go through site visits and interviews before a final decision is
            made.<br /><br />
            Assigning points however, has proved to be a faulty system,
            according to IDPs.<br /><br />
            Monika Dgebuadze, 30, an IDP from Abkhazia who lives in a newly
            built apartment building with her husband and children in Zugdidi,
            explains that there have been families who did not receive housing
            for simple errors that could have been easily remedied while others
            have chosen to rent or sell their homes for various reasons.<br /><br />
            “There are many who don’t want the apartments but also those who are
            seriously in need but did not receive any housing because of simple
            mistakes,” she says. “Even for reasons like not being at home for a
            site visit even though they weren’t warned beforehand of the visit
            and so they didn’t receive an apartment. At the same time there are
            those who don’t even live in Georgia and don’t plan to.”<br /><br />
            This disconnect between displaced communities and the government is
            common. When Maia asked if she could receive additional room in
            consideration of her grandchildren, she says the response was
            dismissive, “This is the space you and your son were given, so live
            in it.”<br />
            <br />Chai Khana contacted the Ministry of Internally Displaced
            Persons from the Occupied Territories, Labor, Health and Social
            Affairs for comment but did not receive a response by the publishing
            date.<br /><br />
            To navigate the system, IDPs have come to rely on NGOs, like the
            Georgian Young Lawyers Association (GYLA), which fill the gap left
            by the government and provide IDPs with legal assistance. The
            assistance provided by such organizations can prove crucial in
            deciding whether IDPs receive a house or not and what conditions
            will await them there.<br /><br />
            “We are currently conducting four cases related to the right to
            housing. Last year GYLA successfully finished two cases regarding
            this issue. However, we are providing free consultation. For
            example, last year 141 IDP received legal consultations,” Nona
            Kurdovanidze, GYLA’s Legal Aid Program Director, told Chai Khana.<br /><br />
            A report authored by GYLA alongside other NGOs working on the issue
            in 2019 found that 74 percent of IDPs named living conditions as the
            major problem they faced, with many also citing inaccessibility to
            essential services such as medical facilities and transportation as
            a serious issue.<br /><br />
            Overall, IDP families continue to lag behind in access to
            opportunity. Many families cited concerns over their inability to
            prepare their children for higher education exams and cover the
            costs even if their child is accepted to a university.<br /><br />
            Of the IDPs interviewed in the report, all of whom lived in
            government assigned or built communities, 70 percent relied on state
            allowances and pensions as their main source of income with only 23
            percent depended on their salary. These statistics provide a grim
            picture of the reality facing many displaced families in Georgia.<br /><br />
            As Maia Bitsadze explains there are down sides faced even by the
            “lucky ones” who are given homes in government built communities.<br /><br />
            “The disadvantage of this program is that several apartment
            buildings are built in one area and handed over to the most needy
            IDP families, creating concentrated poverty,” Bitsadze says.

          <p>
            A lack of IDP participation in the processes that decide their
            futures is a significant part of the issue. A 2020 Internal
            Displacement Monitoring Center report found that while strategies
            have been well-intentioned, their implementation has at times proven
            to be ineffective with IDPs left in the dark about how decisions are
            made at the top.<br /><br />
            “In just two months, they selected the territories, drew up the
            plans in one week, and built the homes, which is very quick,” Nano
            Zazanashvili, an architect and the main researcher in a 2011 study
            on government built IDP communities near Gori, told Chai Khana.<br /><br />
            “The entire process was informal. Some respondents told me that
            everything happened on a one phone call basis: meaning that they
            would call someone, demand that the project plans be drawn up
            quickly, and all decisions were made in this manner.”<br /><br />
            Shortcomings included settlements that lacked schools or other basic
            infrastructure. <br /><br />Nugzar Tinikashvili, Mayor (Gamgebeli)
            of Akhalgori Municipality and an IDP since 2008, agrees there were
            significant problems with how the settlements were built. Nugzar and
            his family received a government-built house in the Tserovani
            settlement, an expansive community that stretches across the plains
            that separate de-facto South Ossetia from the rest of Georgia.
            <br /><br />“There were serious problems facing the settlement.
            Everything had been done in a rushed manner and so there were a lot
            of issues in relation to the speed of construction,” he told Chai
            Khana. <br /><br />For instance, until 2014, when Nugzar was
            elected, there was no hot water or indoor bathrooms. Families had to
            use wooden outhouses located 20 meters from their houses. Since
            Nugzar was elected to oversee the 2,700 families living in Tserovani
            and nearby settlements, they have built bathrooms for all the houses
            and running hot water.<br /><br />
            While the situation has improved today, he noted, the community
            still faces major challenges.<br /><br />
            “The problems we face are similar to those facing the entire
            country, the only difference is that we are also displaced persons.
            Employment is the biggest issue we face but within Tserovani itself
            we have a very good employment rate, with 1,500 people working and
            another 300 people employed in local places,” Nugzar said.<br /><br />
            “It is up to us to share our needs with the government…We select
            projects according to the needs of the population, since I myself am
            an IDP and live here, I see what our needs are.”<br /><br />
            A 2019 World Bank Report shows that 14.5 percent of IDPs are
            unemployed, although in rural areas the figure was estimated to be
            closer to 40 percent. Seventy percent of displaced persons surveyed
            in the report described themselves as underemployed.<br /><br />
            So-called “old IDPs,” including those that came from Abkhazia in the
            1990s, have been shown to have at least 10 percent lower monthly
            wages than their local counterparts according to the Institute of
            Labor Economics. A 2009 UNHCR report also shows that IDP children
            are more vulnerable than their local counterparts and at times have
            to leave school earlier to support the family.<br /><br />
            The picture is not uniformly dark for all IDPs, however. Due to the
            variety of donors financing IDP housing, some families end up living
            in substantially better housing than others.<br /><br />
            The Danish Refugee Council has been implementing housing projects
            for IDPs in Georgia for decades. However, IDPs that qualify for
            housing provided by the Danish Refugee Council receive homes that
            meet international norms and standards.<br /><br />
            The DRC has a rigorous selection process to evaluate IDP families
            for housing. One of the criteria that sets DRC apart from the
            government is that they require families to actually own the plots
            of land upon which their future homes will be built.<br /><br />
            Unlike with government housing, IDP families have more of a say when
            working with the DRC.<br /><br />
            After projects start, the DRC has a monitoring team of its own
            engineers who are actively involved in the oversight of
            construction. Families themselves are also involved in this process,
            noted Nino Khokhobaia, the Head of Programmes for the DRC.<br /><br />
            “The beneficiaries themselves are often the best monitoring
            mechanism, since it is their home that is being built. Anytime there
            is even the smallest delay, they always call us to notify us,” she
            said. <br /><br />Khvicha Barbakadze and his wife Tamar Kiknadze,
            who have a young child, are IDPs who are currently waiting to
            receive a home from the DRC. They currently live in Tbilisi but
            their home is being built near the city of Khashuri.

            received a house in his ancestral village of Sasireti. Although they
            have never met, the house they received is identical in layout and
            quality. (Credit: Nika Vetsko)

            Khvicha and his family fled Abkhazia during the 1992-1993 war, and
            for years the family was forced to live in a 20-square-meter room in
            an old sanatorium in Tbilisi. “The conditions there were terrible.
            We lived there until 2015-2016,” he recalled.<br /><br />
            Once he and Tamar got married in 2016, they rented an apartment and
            left the sanatorium. The government’s housing policy was in full
            swing by that time, so Khvicha was optimistic they would qualify for
            an apartment. But according to the government’s point system, they
            were too wealthy to qualify since they had paid a lump sum to live
            in the apartment for a set period, a common arrangement in
            Tbilisi.<br /><br />
            “I called the Ministry and they told me that I didn’t fit into any
            categories; to get a higher score there would have to be a veteran
            in my family or someone with a socially vulnerable status or have a
            lot of loans. Happily, I’m actually not as vulnerable as others. And
            there were people in my neighborhood who were worse off than I was,
            and they didn’t even get a high score so I knew there was no point,”
            he said.<br /><br />
            Instead, the couple applied for a house under the DRC program based
            on a piece of family property in Khashuri. Their application was
            approved in November 2020 and construction started in June 2021 and
            is nearly finished, Khvicha said. The 54-square-meter house will
            have a kitchen, living room, bathroom and two bedrooms.<br /><br />
            “I know a lot of people who received an apartment in Tbilisi from
            the government and none of them are satisfied,” he said. “Here, as
            far as I can see, they oversee and control everything, and the
            quality is very good. I tell everyone I know around me that if they
            want to live in a village this is the ideal option... As far as I
            can see there’s less competition here, for some reason everyone
            wants an apartment.”

            <span>Caption:</span> Guram Elbakidze, 83, and his wife, Ana, who is
            South Ossetian, live in the same building as Maia and her family.
            After fleeing their village during the 2008 war, they ended up here,
            while their daughter continues to live and work in Tskhinvali.
            <br /><br />Guram said the government canceled their social
            assistance, which amounts to 45 lari ($15) per month per person,
            because an inspector decided they had nothing to complain about
            since “They seemed to be quite well off as they had two rooms to
            live in for both of them.”
