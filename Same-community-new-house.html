            Karabakh residents Nelson, 48, and Susanna Hayiryan, 44, are tired
            of moving.<br /><br />
            The couple has relocated three times since their native village fell
            to Azerbaijan during the 2020 Karabakh war. Now the de-facto
            Karabakh government wants them to uproot and move again.<br /><br />
            The Hayiryans are among the 38,000 people the Karabakh government
            estimates lost their homes during the war. After nearly 16 months of
            ad hoc and temporary housing fixes, the government now has a plan
            for the displaced. Over the next two years, an estimated 2500
            families will be moved into newly built villages across
            government-controlled territory.<br /><br />
            Earlier this year, the Nagorno-Karabakh Housing Committee outlined
            the new plan. For instance, the government will provide an apartment
            in Stepanakert (Khankendi) for families of soldiers who died or went
            missing during the war. Apartments will also be provided for those
            displaced from the towns of Shushi (Shusha) and Hadrut. Everyone
            will be relocated to government-provided housing in new communities.
          </p>

            Stepanakert.

          <p>
            The planned 957 houses in 10 communities will cost an estimated
            $94.5 million which will be covered by the state budget, the
            Hayastan All-Armenian Fund and individual benefactors. The
            government is also planning to repair houses in Karabakh-controlled
            territory that were damaged by the war.<br /><br />
            The Hayastan All-Armenian Fund already started construction on one
            new community, near Astghashen. Known as the New Village, displaced
            families from four villages—Sghnakh (Sığnaq), Mokhshmhat, Madatashen
            and Jrakhacner—will be resettled there. The New Village is being
            built by Kapavor LLC, which is owned by a Russian businessman
            originally from Sghnakh.
          </p>
          <img src="images/tractors.png" alt="story" />
          <p>
            Yeghishe Ghahramanyan, who served as mayor of Shgnakh before the
            war, has been coordinating communication between the builders and
            the villagers.<br /><br />
            “I called all the villagers one by one and asked if they were ready
            to live in this newly built village,” he said. “All the villagers
            agreed unequivocally.”<br /><br />
            But for some, like the Hayiryans, the policy feels like another
            upheaval after months of struggle to restart their lives following
            the war.<br /><br />
            The family fled first to Armenia after Sghnakh fell to Azerbaijani
            forces in 2020. After the war, they moved to Stepanakert, where the
            government paid for their rent in the city. But when rent prices
            spiked in 2021, the government assistance was not enough, and they
            moved to nearby Sosh. Today the government subsidy covers $170 of
            the $210 monthly rent. They pay the rest from their income selling
            fresh produce at the local market.<br /><br />
            Another move would mean starting over again. <br /><br />
            They would need to give up their clients at the market and return to
            farming on the 1000 square-meters of land provided by the
            government. Their daughter, Nanar, 23, an art teacher at the school
            in Sosh, would need to find a new career as no school or
            kindergarten is planned for the new village.<br /><br />
            “I have already adapted to the school and work here, I would not
            want to leave this job,” she said. <br /><br />Her father added that
            the government’s resources could be better spent if it allowed
            people to decide where they want to live.<br /><br />
            "It would be better if they give that money to the villagers
            directly to build houses. They could build their house wherever they
            want. Maybe I want to build a house in Armenia, or right here in
            Shosh," Nelson said.<br /><br />
            But the government believes the new policy will help Karabakh
            “maintain communication and production lines as well as
            proportionately develop its territory,” according to the housing
            committee.<br /><br />
            In addition, there are not enough apartments in Stepanakert to house
            all the displaced. The intense demand for housing following the war
            led to a spike in housing prices in the town: for instance the
            average rent for a two-bedroom apartment increased from $80 to $200.
            <br /><br />
            Signs of construction are everywhere in Nagorno Karabakh. While New
            Village is just 19 km from Stepanakert, other new communities are
            being built around the republic. The government’s plan calls for the
            settlements to be located near existing villages to make it easier
            to supply electricity, water and gas.<br /><br />
            Some families are eager to move to the new settlements. To date 1500
            families have requested houses in the new communities, according to
            the housing committee.<br /><br />
            “We have registered the residents of four villages and 136
            apartments are needed to house all the displaced," David Grigoryan,
            who is managing the construction of New Village, said. In total, 221
            apartments will be built in the village by the end of 2022 . All
            necessary infrastructure, including the roads and electricity, gas
            and water lines, will also be finished by the end of the year.<br /><br />
            Yeghishe Ghahramanyan, the Sghnakh mayor, noted that New Village is
            being built in stages, so not all families will be able to settle at
            once. The first houses will go to families who are helping build the
            new village.

            Gegham Avanesyan, a native of Jrakhacner, who is currently living in
            Asghashen with his family, is eager to move in. Gegham is even
            helping to build New Village with one of his former neighbors, Ashot
            Arustamyan.<br /><br />
            “We are currently renting a house in Astghashen and I want to have a
            permanent home for my three children,” Gegham said. “It's good to
            work here because we are both earning an income and the chance to be
            first to receive a new house.”<br /><br />
            Anush Lalayan, a native of Sghnakh, has heard about the ongoing
            construction but she does not plan on joining her former neighbors
            in the new village. Anush now lives in Stepanakert with her
            11-year-old daughter, and, under the government’s plan, they will be
            able to stay in the city as her husband died in the last days of the
            war.<br /><br />
            “Although months have passed, even now when I wake up, for the first
            few seconds I cannot believe that I am not in my house in Sghnakh,
            that life has turned upside down and I have lost both my beloved
            village and my husband,” Anush said.<br /><br />
            “I loved my village very much, and if it were under Armenian control
            tomorrow, I would be the first to return there. But nothing ties me
            to the newly built village, especially when my husband is no longer
            with me.”
