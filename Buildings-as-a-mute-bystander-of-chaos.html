            Buildings are often the mute bystanders to the social, economic, and
            political events taking place around them. The Industrial
            Pedagogical Technicum in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi is a
            perfect example.<br /><span class="custom-br"></span> Over the past
            four decades the building has served as an architectural monument, a
            place of higher learning and a makeshift home for an estimated 65
            families who were displaced from Abkhazia during the 1991-1992
            fighting and the Tskhinvali region during the 2008 Russo-Georgian
            War.<br /><span class="custom-br"></span> The building, located at 4
            Marshal Gelovani Avenue, was designed by Georgian architect Nikoloz
            Lasareishvili and completed in 1978. The style of the building is
            rooted in Constructivism and Latin American Modernism.<br /><span
              class="custom-br"
            ></span>
            “Nikoloz Lasariashvili selected a color palette that would blend in
            seamlessly with the terrain surrounding the Technical School,” noted
            architect Levan Kalandarishvili, an architect and lecturer at the
            Free University’s Visual Arts, Architecture & Design School.<br />
            “Architects at the time were unable to develop anything unique
            outside standard typology, yet with excellent proportions and
            symmetry, this structure stands out. The windows also accurately
            depict the architecture of the time; nothing is overstated.”<br /><span
              class="custom-br"
            ></span>
            Initially, the Industrial Pedagogical Technicum was divided into
            five major sections: the main block, which included classrooms and
            administrative offices; an auditorium attached to the main block; a
            workshop and recreational facility which included a gymnasium; a
            bridge connecting the main block to the facilities; and a
            sixteen-story dormitory building behind the Industrial Technicum.

            The Technicum, located on a hillside on the border of the Saburtalo
            and Dighomi districts, is somehow isolated from the rest of the
            city. For years, the only element visible through the dense
            vegetation was a sculpture by Zurab Tsererteli that adorned the
            auditorium facade until 2018.<br /><span class="custom-br"></span>
            During the Soviet Union, the building was home to a school that
            prepared students to become teachers at vocational schools across
            the former Soviet world in industrial and civil engineering,
            agriculture technology, metalworking and installing and maintaining
            industrial equipment. Five-hundred and seventy people graduated from
            the Technicum, according to “Party Life of the
            Industrial-Pedagogical Technical School,” an article published in
            Tbilisi magazine in 1978.
          </p>

          <p>
            The main feature of the sculpture was a male figure with golden
            bat-like wings looking out toward the passing traffic.<br />
            The bas relief's bat-like wings were known locally as "Tbilisi
            Batman," even though most of the passersby were unaware of the
            extent of the space behind.<br /><span class="custom-br"></span
            >Today, the Industrial Pedagogical Technicum serves several
            functions and the people using it do not communicate with each
            other, creating a chaotic situation inside and out.<br /><span
              class="custom-br"
            ></span>
            The families living there, known as IDPs, are forced to live in
            perpetual uncertainty. The government allows them to live in the
            building, but it is not their property. Multiple efforts to
            privatize the building have added to their sense that this is a
            temporary residence, albeit one they have been stuck in for 30
            years. The building’s de facto tenants struggle to rebuild, change,
            or improve their living conditions, due to the specificity of the
            space as well as their lack of ownership and influence over the
            building’s future and resources. The building is currently on the
            property of the Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development’s
            Legal Entity of Public Law (LEPL). It houses Icarus College,
            Abkhazia School #2 and a kindergarten.<br /><span
              class="custom-br"
            ></span>
            It is obvious from the facade of the building that it serves many
            functions. In the section dedicated to Icarus College, the windows
            boast modern, insulated plastic frames. The IDP settlement, on the
            other hand, has original aluminum rotating windows in the front and
            the old wooden windows in the back. IDPs also created new, informal
            entrances to the building.

                    Researcher and architect Thomas Ibrahim became interested in
                    the Industrial Pedagogical Technicum in 2016, when he wanted
                    to learn more about its structure and unique characteristics
                    as an example of social modernism architecture. The building
                    was in considerably better shape at that time, and Zurab
                    Tsereteli's relief sculpture was still affixed to its
                    facade.

                  <p>
                    As Ibrahim recalls, the relief began to vanish from the
                    facade in early 2018. Its disappearance led to wider
                    interest in how the lives of the displaced intersected with
                    the building itself, as well as efforts to restore it.
                    During the Tbilisi Architecture Biennial, an installation
                    was made of wire to highlight the missing pieces of the
                    sculpture.

                  <p>
                    In December of the same year, he launched the Agora
                    Exhibition at Industrial Technicum. The exhibit was part of
                    INHABIT! Tbilisi, post-Soviet, a project that reexamined and
                    explored repurposing former public structures for
                    contemporary use. The Agora Exhibition was the first step in
                    making the space more public and active.<br /><span
                      class="custom-br"
                    ></span>
                    The manually built stairway made the terrace and auditorium
                    publicly accessible and served as an exhibition space, a
                    playground for the children living in the IDP communities,
                    and a workshop area. It even resulted in some graffiti on
                    the walls, indicating that someone had been there recently,
                    rather than decades before. According to the project, in an
                    ideal scenario, this public area would serve the IDP
                    community living in the building and would host activities
                    that would help them further integrate into city life.<br /><span
                      class="custom-br"
                    ></span>
                    “I was initially fascinated by the sculpture by Zurab
                    Tsereteli that was affixed to the auditorium facade of the
                    building. The fact that the relief was stolen catalyzed the
                    process and made me return and investigate. I was also
                    working on a Biennale at that time. Then I became more
                    familiar with the people who live there. I was thinking that
                    it would be valuable to make a public space specially for
                    IDPs living there, so that they could communicate more and
                    be more involved in city life.”

                    “The project was well received at the time by the residents
                    who lived there; we held workshops and the Agora Exhibition
                    there. We first built the staircase to have access to the
                    terrace because I thought it brought the most value for
                    anyone living there. Before you had to climb up beside the
                    building to reach it. We simply cleaned the space; in fact,
                    the municipality came to clean the space. I think that’s
                    what the space needed for that moment. Of course, we wanted
                    to do more there to develop it further.”

                    ​​“People would go up there because they were curious to see
                    the terrace and the view from there. Then we held the
                    workshop there; we had some wood left over from the
                    workshop, so we made the furniture workshop, and we invited
                    some students who were also working on the Architecture
                    Biennial. We started building furniture there with some of
                    the residents. We began to construct some things, including
                    a 7-meter-long gigantic swing. We started making a terrace a
                    little bit like a playground.”<br /><span

                    the purpose of creating a public space for them as well,
                    they became more involved and interested as they had a
                    little more hope that something would happen to transform

                    Industrial Pedagogical Technicum also houses Icarus, a
                    professional college that offers courses in tourism-related
                    fields and carries the building’s legacy as a place of
                    higher learning. <br />The socialist modernist architecture
                    belies the college’s focus on the modern demands of the
                    economy. <br /><span class="custom-br"></span>

                    Natalia Odikadze, 35, began her studies in 2019 and
                    graduated in 2021. She now works in a local pizzeria and
                    raises her three children.

                    “I attended Icarus College and majored in the culinary arts.
                    We learned about Georgian, European, and global cuisines. It
                    was not difficult to find work after I graduated. It is much
                    more difficult for those who enter the field without
                    studying. I already had some of the knowledge and experience
                    required for the job from college.”<br /><span

                    “This place is somewhat difficult to reach... I used to come
                    here from Rustavi, which is a bit far. Because the pandemic
                    started not long after I started studying, I had to attend
                    the distance learning program part time.”

                    “When I started studying, the relief sculpture by Zurab
                    Tsereteli that had been affixed to the building's facade had
                    already vanished and collapsed. I have no other clear memory
                    of it. IDPs, as far as I know, occupy the other half of the
                    building, and their living space is separated from the
                    school by a wall. They're on one side, the college is on the
                    other side, and we didn’t have any direct credits with them.
                    There are separate entrances to the building. All my
                    attention was on learning. When you go into the kitchen, you
                    finish one dish and start another; that was my entire focus,
                    and aside from the lecturers and students, I didn't
                    communicate much with the others.”

                    “When I think back on college, in addition to my profession,
                    the architecture of the building looms large in my mind. I
                    don't understand much about architecture, but it's something
                    different…Once a person enters the building, they will
                    definitely remember it. I recall that when we started
                    studying, I took pictures of the entrance and on the stairs,
                    it seemed so interesting to me.”

                  <p>
                    “If I had studied architecture there, I would have seen this
                    building differently, but there are some features that are
                    memorable even for the average visitor, not to mention an
                    architect's eye. It is more than just a college building or
                    a kitchen.”

                    Demo, 25, has lived in the Industrial Pedagogical Technicum
                    his entire life. His mother is a native of Abkhazia and
                    arrived at the Industrial Pedagogical Technicum in 1992,
                    when she and her family were forced to flee their homes due
                    the war. She was 12.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    “This space was originally used as a classroom. There was
                    nothing when we arrived, not even a bathroom or a kitchen.
                    There was only one large space, which we later partitioned
                    with thin walls. We used to live on the other side of the
                    building, in a space a third of this size. We moved around
                    to different parts of the building for the first five to six
                    years, frequently changing addresses (in the same building).
                    We lived on the fourth floor for five years, until my sister
                    was born and then we decided to expand a little, given that
                    we were in such a small space. By this time, the 2008 war
                    had already occurred, the IDPs had been resettled, and the
                    only free room in the building was this one. Dividing space
                    between the neighbors was not an easy task either.”<br /><span
                      class="custom-br"
                    ></span>
                    The space where he lives now with his mother and younger
                    sister used to be a college auditorium, and even after more
                    than 30 years, it still holds traces of its original design.
                    Demo says he realized early on that the family would not be
                    offered better living quarters soon, so they began
                    constructing thin walls to separate the space into several
                    rooms.
                  </p>
                  <img src="images/demo-2.jpeg" alt="modal" />
                  <p>
                    However, as Demo points out, this did not occur in a single
                    day; due to the family’s finances, it took a long time, and
                    the family worked on it from one summer to the next. Demo
                    recalls he always struggled to connect with his peers who
                    were not displaced: initially he went to a school in the
                    building for displaced children, but eventually he
                    transferred to a mainstream, public school. But even then,
                    he says it was difficult to make friends and he never
                    brought anyone over. Today he is focused on working and
                    caring for his mother and his sister.

                  <p>
                    “When I start a family, I most probably won't live here. I
                    don't want my children or significant other to go through
                    what I did. I must do everything in my power to prevent them
                    from seeing and experiencing what I went through. If I have
                    the means, I will take my mother and sister with me as
                    well.”
                    <br /><span class="custom-br"></span>
                    After he graduated from medical school, he started working
                    in a local hospital and became a personal trainer to earn
                    extra income.
                    <br /><span class="custom-br"></span>
                    “I began working when I was 16, my mother needed my help and
                    support. I began working in my profession when I was 18,
                    when I went to the clinic. In the medical field, you start
                    at the bottom and work your way up, so that is what I did. I
                    am now a junior doctor at the Republic Hospital's
                    Therapeutic Department. In addition, I have two jobs in
                    different clinics to help me advance in my career. In the
                    future, I hope to work as a pediatric surgeon. In addition,
                    I work part-time as a personal trainer at a gym.”

                    Not every household has the means to improve the space they
                    were assigned. <br /><span class="custom-br"></span> “We
                    entered this space in 2008, but we were unable to improve it
                    immediately due to financial reasons. We began doing all of
                    this in stages. We saved money gradually, also we borrowed a
                    little and remodeled step by step. We did the bathroom first
                    because we used the communal bathroom before. It took us
                    more than five years to complete everything step by
                    step.”<br />
                    “They have promised to give us housing but, like always, it
                    remains just an idea. My mother has always tried to legalize
                    our home or find us a new place to live. However, nothing
                    has ever worked. We must always take care of ourselves.
                    Housing should not, in my opinion, be the subject of such a
                    broad debate today; you either have it or you don't. In our
                    case, it's somewhere in the middle: we have it, and we
                    don't. It's yours, but it's not entirely yours. You also
                    can't rent it or sell it. <br />As the building belonged to
                    a college, we didn’t have to pay for our electricity before.
                    Then, a tax was imposed. They said it was because we have
                    lived here for so long. In that case, either make the place
                    ours or do something to help us, I thought.”

                    “Two or three heaters could not heat such a large area. I
                    also needed a room because my little sister ran around, and
                    I needed a place to study.
                    <br /><span class="custom-br"></span>
                    Finally, we completed the kitchen as well as the divider… to
                    prevent people from entering the kitchen directly from the
                    entrance. I built these walls almost entirely by myself,
                    having learned the craft from scratch.”

                    “I've lived in this building for as long as I can remember.
                    I've spent 13 years in this exact place. It was difficult to
                    live in the conditions that existed there initially, so we
                    decided to do something about it ourselves, while not
                    knowing whether the government would legalize these quarters
                    for us or provide us with a new place. We have tried to live
                    like ordinary people, and that is why we decided to build
                    little by little. I created nearly everything that you see
                    now. When you live like one of us, you learn to live without
                    the help of others. In some ways, this was useful because I
                    have gained experiences that other people do not have.”
