        Three generations have been touched by conflict in the South Caucasus.
        The disputes over Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh and South Ossetia have
        displaced hundreds of thousands of people across Armenia, Azerbaijan and
        Georgia over the past 30 years. Just as each conflict is defined by its
        own unique tragedies, so have the lives of the displaced in all three
        countries been shaped by the politics, culture and society of their
        communities. This project explores the stories behind the
        displacement--the fate of those who had to flee their homes and the
        response of the governments, towns and villages that took them in.Â
