          Three generations have been touched by conflict in the South Caucasus.
          The disputes over Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh and South Ossetia have
          displaced hundreds of thousands of people across Armenia, Azerbaijan
          and Georgia over the past 30 years. Just as each conflict is defined
          by its own unique tragedies, so have the lives of the displaced in all
          three countries been shaped by the politics, culture and society of
          their communities. This project explores the stories behind the
          displacement - the fate of those who had to flee their homes and the
          response of the governments, towns and villages that took them in.
